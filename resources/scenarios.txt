You chose to sleep some more. You thought to yourself "I'm gonna die anyway,
might as well enjoy my day". 

You slept for 2 more hours.

You woke up at 10am. You were pretty much late at this point. You thought 
if you should go to school today.

You chose to sleep even more. Man, you must have been tired.

You slept for 4 more hours.

You woke up at 2am. You missed lunch and were getting kinda hungry.
You wonder why your parents didn't wake you to eat.

title: Hello Jesus
You decided to sleep even more. Apparently, this was a bad idea.
While you were sleeping, you felt a strange pain in your chest.
Apparently, you had a heart attack and never woke up.
